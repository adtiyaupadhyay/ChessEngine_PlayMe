# ChessEngine_PlayMe
PlayMe is a Python-based chess engine with all standard features like offline and online play. Its unique twist: it learns your style in parallel, trains a bot based on your gameplay, and lets you challenge your own clone. You can even upload your bot to the cloud for others to play.
